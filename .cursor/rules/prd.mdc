# Slack-Notion Internal Assistant

---

- **Purpose:**
The Slack-Notion Internal Assistant enables users to query and update information in the company Notion workspace directly from Slack. It provides fast, context-aware answers to workspace questions (e.g., playbooks, project steps) and can perform safe, targeted modifications to Notion content as instructed by users. The agent is designed for internal use by VRSEN AI team members to streamline knowledge access and operational workflows, while minimizing risk of accidental data loss or unwanted changes in Notion.
- **Communication Flows:**
    - **Between Agents:**
        - If extended, the agent may interact with other internal agents (e.g., for advanced workflow automation or escalation of complex requests). Shared state may include Slack message context and Notion page references.
    - **Agent to User Communication:**
        - The agent communicates with users via Slack messages in designated channels. It responds to direct queries and action requests, providing clear feedback and confirmation of actions taken.

# üåê Background:

VRSEN AI needs an internal agent that enables team members to query and update Notion workspace content directly from Slack. The agent must answer questions (e.g., about playbooks or project steps) and perform safe, targeted modifications to Notion pages, without risking accidental data loss or unwanted changes. This will streamline internal knowledge access and operational workflows.

## üèÜ Primary Goal:

Develop a Slack bot that can answer questions based on the Notion workspace and perform safe, targeted actions on it as instructed by users.
